## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Database Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) focused on detecting SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks. The project targets identifying abnormal queries to enhance database security by utilizing anomaly-based detection, machine learning, regex, and text analysis techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Anomaly-Based Detection Method:** A model will be developed to learn normal query behaviors in the database, allowing for the identification of abnormal or malicious queries.
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) will be used for anomaly detection in SQL queries.
- **Regex and String Analysis:** Regex and text analysis techniques will be leveraged to detect known patterns associated with SQL Injection attacks.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and effective solution for database security.
